# Graph Interpretation Guide

This guide summarises the key plots generated by the asset analysis pipeline
and offers tips on how to interpret them once the underlying price series are
split- and dividend-adjusted.

## Adjusted Price Series
Plots the adjusted closing price through time. Look for long-term trends,
regime changes and structural breaks (e.g. post-crisis recoveries or drawdowns).

## Log-Return Timeline and Histogram
The timeline shows the day-to-day (or selected interval) log-returns centred
around zero, highlighting large jumps associated with events. The accompanying
histogram reveals the return distribution; heavy tails relative to a normal
curve indicate elevated crash or jump risk.

## GARCH Overlay
The grey bars repeat the log-returns while the red line shows the modelled
conditional volatility from a GARCH(1,1) fit. Expect the red line to climb
rapidly during crises and drift lower in calmer regimes, demonstrating
volatility clustering. Severe spikes in the grey bars without corresponding
volatility response often flag data problems.

## HAR Realised Volatility Forecast
Daily realised variance (squared log-returns) feeds the HAR-RV benchmark. The
blue line tracks realised volatility while the orange dashed extension projects
the next few days via the fitted HAR coefficients. Forecasts that sit well above
recent realised levels signal a volatility regime change; flat forecasts imply
mean reversion toward the recent range.

## Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA)
The singularity spectrum \(f(\alpha)\) summarises the strength of
multifractality. A narrow, peaked curve implies near-monofractal behaviour,
whereas a broad support indicates heterogeneous scaling exponents and
intermittency.

## Rescaled-Range (R/S) Scaling
The logâ€“log slope of the aggregated ranges estimates the Hurst exponent \(H\).
Values near 0.5 reflect memoryless behaviour; \(H>0.5\) suggests persistence
and \(H<0.5\) points to mean-reversion/antipersistence. Compare the empirical
points to the fitted trend line printed with the estimated \(H\).

## Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA)
Shows the fluctuation function versus window size with the fitted slope. The
slope again corresponds to \(H\); curvature or slope shifts hint at different
scaling regimes or non-stationarity in the series.

## Structure-Function Diagnostics
The left panel tracks the scaling exponents \(\tau(q)\) against \(q\) with a
lognormal cascade fit. Deviations from linearity highlight multifractality. The
right panel plots \(f(\alpha)\); a wider spectrum corresponds to stronger
intermittency.

## Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima (WTMM) Diagnostics
Wavelet-based analogue of the structure-function plots. Consistency between the
WTMM and structure-function spectra strengthens confidence in detected
multifractality. Large discrepancies may signal numerical or data issues.
