    The series is reindexed to ``freq`` using ``Series.asfreq``. Single missing
    observations are forward-filled while longer gaps remain as ``NaN`` so they
    can be handled explicitly downstream.

    Parameters
    ----------
    series : pd.Series
        Input time series indexed by timestamp.
    freq : str
        Target frequency string understood by pandas (e.g. ``"1min"``).

    -------
    pd.Series
        Series resampled to ``freq`` with isolated gaps filled and larger ones

    Parameters
    ----------
    series : pd.Series
        Input price series indexed by timestamp.
    z_thresh : float, default 6.0
        Observations with a modified z-score greater than this threshold
        are treated as outliers.

    Returns
    -------
    pd.Series
        Cleaned series with outliers interpolated. The original input is
        left unmodified.

    approximation coefficients (up to ``level``) to zero before reconstructing
    the series.  This acts as an orthogonal detrending step which preserves
    highâ€‘frequency fluctuations important for multifractal analysis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    series : pd.Series
        Input time series.
    wavelet : str, default "db4"
        Mother wavelet name understood by :mod:`pywt`.
    level : int, optional
        Decomposition level.  When ``None`` the maximum level permitted by the
        data length is used.
